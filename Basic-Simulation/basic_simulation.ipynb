    "## Running the Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we run the simulation, we need to set some parameters to control the total length and step size of an integration. Swiftest \n",
    "sets a Simulation object up with a set of default parameters, including a default unit system of AU, y, and solar masses. However, \n",
    "you are required to set the ``tstop`` and ``dt`` parameters before running the simulation. These control the total time of the \n",
    "simulation and the time step size, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The symplectic integrators used in Swiftest are not adaptive, so the time step size is fixed throughout the simulation.\n",
    "    Typically you want to choose a step size that is no more than 1/20th of the shortest orbital period in the system. So for the\n",
    "    solar system, a step size of 0.01 y is a good choice in order to accurately model Mercury's orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important consideration is the number of steps you wish to save and how often the output is saved to file (the output \n",
    "cadence). By default, Swiftest will save every output step to disk. However, Swiftest is designed to simulate systems for long \n",
    "periods of time, so it is often not practical to save every single time step to disk. There are three ways to control how many \n",
    "steps are saved to file: `tstep_out`, `istep_out`, and `nstep_out`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`istep_out`\n",
    ": This is the integer number of time steps between output saves to file, which can be used to control the output \n",
    "  cadence.  For example, if you set `istep_out=1000`, then the simulation will save the system every 1000 time steps. This is \n",
    "  useful if you want to save the system every N time steps, regardless of the time interval between steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "`tstep_out`\n",
    ": This is the approximate time interval between output steps. This is the most intuitive way to control the output \n",
    "  cadence. It is the time interval between each output step in the simulation. For example, if you set `tstep_out=1e3`, then the \n",
    "  simulation will save the system every 1000 y. Internally, Swiftest uses the integer value `istep_out` to control the output \n",
    "  cadence, which is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    istep_out = floor(tstep_out/dt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Only one of either `tstep_out` or `istep_out` should be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "`dump_cadence`\n",
    ": Simulation data is stored in NetCDF format, which is a self-describing binary file format that is widely used in the scientific\n",
    "community. However, writing to disk is a slow process, so writing to disk can be a bottleneck in the simulation. To mitigate this,\n",
    "Swiftest has a `dump_cadence` parameter that controls how often the simulation data is written to disk. The integer value passed \n",
    "to `dump_cadence` controls the number of output steps (as determined `istep_out`) between when the saved data is dumped to a \n",
    "file. The default value is 10, which means that Swiftest will store 10 outputs in memory before dumping them to file. \n",
    "Setting `dump_cadence` to 0 is a a special case that tells Swiftest to store *all* output in memory until the end of the \n",
    "simulation. This is useful for short simulations, but can be memory intensive for long simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    " >note: Changing the value of ``dump_cadence`` does not change the amount of data that is output by the end of the simulation. It only\n",
    "  changes how often the data is written to disk. Changing the value of ``tstep_out`` (or ``istep_out``) *does* change the amount of\n",
    "  data that is output by the end of the simulation. Intermediate steps between output steps are not saved to disk, and cannot be\n",
    "  recovered after the simulation has finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of what values to set for `tstep_out` (or `istep_out`), `nstep_out`, and `dump_cadence` depends on the particular\n",
    "simulation. Higher values of `dump_cadence` are typically useful for simulations with small numbers of bodies and small values\n",
    "of `tstep_out` where frequent writing to disk can severely impact performance. For simulations with large numbers of bodies and \n",
    "larger values of `tstep_out`, it is often better to set `dump_cadence` to a smaller value and write the data to disk more often\n",
    "so that the memory usage does not become too large. The default value of `dump_cadence` of 10 is a good compromise for most use\n",
    "caes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can set these simulation parameters using the `Simulation.set_parameter` method. \n",
    "Here we have a simulation that runs for 100,000 y a step size of 0.01 y. We will also save the system every 1000 y and wait until the end\n",
